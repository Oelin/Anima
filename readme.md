# Anima

A little scripting language that's easy to to read, write and learn. The frontend is nearly finished.


```ruby
def count(n)
  for i in range(n)
    print(i)
  end
end
```

### features (current and future)

* weak typing
* named and anonymous functions
* lambda functions
* Pythonic ternary, i.e. `<expr> if <expr> else <expr>`
* Pythonic for loops, i.e. `for <variable> in <iterator>`
* `end` instead of curly braces, similar to Ruby
* list comprehensions
* JavaScript object literals
