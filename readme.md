# Anima

A little scripting language that's easy to to read, write and learn. Made mostly for fun and learning. Still a
work-in-progress.

```ruby
def count(n)
  for i in range(n)
    say(i)
  end
end
```


### Features

* Clean syntax
* Lambdas
* Pythonic for loops: `for <variable> in <iterator>`
* Regular expressions
* Quick lexing
