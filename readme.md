# Anima

A little scripting language that's easy to to read, write and learn. The frontend is nearly finished.


```ruby
def count(n)
  for i in range(n)
    print(i)
  end
end
```

### Current and future features

* Weak typing
* Closures
* Lambdas and IIFEs
* Pythonic ternary operator: `<expr> if <expr> else <expr>`
* Pythonic for loops: `for <variable> in <iterator>`
* Pythonic dictionaries
* JavaScript style `this`
